### About the Analyses

#### What should I do if the analysis tools (shiny apps) are not loading? 
If the analysis tools are not loading on the website, you can try acessing them directly, by following these links for the [Meta-Analytic Visualisations](https://metavoice.shinyapps.io/visualization/) and the [Power Analysis](https://metavoice.shinyapps.io/power_analysis/). If they are not loading on these links, please [contact us](./about.html).
