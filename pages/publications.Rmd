### Using MetaVoice Data

Researchers are allowed to use data available on the MetaVoice website. This can be in the form of citing meta-analytic results, or downloading dataset and conducting custom analyses. In both cases our citation policy is the following:

1. Researchers publishing or presenting work using data in MetaVoice must cite the publications linked to that dataset, as listed in the [Documentation](/documentation.html#datasets). (If there is no citation, then no citation for the individual dataset is necessary).

2. For referencing the use of MetaVoice, please also cite at least one of the following:    
    * REFERENCE 1
    * REFERENCE 2

3. If researchers use more than five datasets, we ask users as a courtesy to cite all data. But in case of severe space limitations, the MetaVoice database as a whole alone may be cited.

4. Since the MetaVoice site is continuously updated, we recommend that you list the date of download for your data in your manuscript. For example: "We analyze all data currently in MetaVoice (REFERENCE). Data were downloaded on 2020-11-01."
